**Kaspeak SDK** is a tool for fast and convenient development of decentralized applications on the Kaspa network.  
All network operations, message processing, data packing and unpacking, cryptography, and transaction handling are performed automatically. Developers do not need to dive into low-level networking details, manage transactions manually, or set up encryption themselves. The SDK offers a ready-made solution with a transparent API and a high level of abstraction.
