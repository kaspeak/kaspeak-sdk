# Kaspeak SDK

**Kaspeak SDK** is a tool for quickly and conveniently creating decentralized applications on the Kaspa BlockDAG. The SDK takes care of all low-level tasks: forming, sending and receiving messages, handling transactions and cryptography.

## What you can do with the SDK

- Create and transmit any textual or binary data through Kaspa transactions.
- Easily develop custom message types with automatic serialization and callbacks.
- Utilize built-in cryptographic methods for data protection and authentication (ECDH, XChaCha20-Poly1305, Schnorr).
- Minimize transaction fees through compact data packaging using CBOR and Zstandard compression.
- Make confidential conversations using unique cryptographic identifiers.
- Run applications seamlessly both in the browser and Node.js environments without additional effort.

Kaspeak SDK frees you from needing to dive into network interaction details and cryptography. Focus on your application's logicâ€”we've taken care of the rest.

Launch a chat, game, bot, or any other application directly on the Kaspa network. Quickly, securely, without intermediaries or censorship.
